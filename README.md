# Sherloque

**Sherloque is a different kind of code search extension for VSCode.**

[ ![Codeship Status for calebpeterson/sherloque-vscode](https://app.codeship.com/projects/e7676420-ee91-0136-fd11-0aadc339175b/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/320131) [![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/cubicle6.sherloque.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cubicle6.sherloque) [![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs/cubicle6.sherloque.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cubicle6.sherloque) [![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/rating/cubicle6.sherloque.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cubicle6.sherloque)

It uses a full text search engine and intelligent tokenization to enable you to quickly find what you’re looking for, even when you’re not quite sure what it’s called.

Traditional code search tools, whether a part of our IDEs, or CLI-based are fantastic tools for finding what you need, _if you know exactly what you need to find but just don’t know where it is_.

**What about when you’re learning a new codebase or stepping back into a large one and you don’t know or cannot remember the exact name of what you’re looking for?**

Focus on finding the code you need instead of remembering the exact class/function/method name.

## Installation

Sherloque is free to try with no limit to the evaluation period. Install it directly from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cubicle6.sherloque) or open the **Command Palette** (by default `Ctrl+P`, `Cmd+P` on macOS), and run:

`ext install cubicle6.sherloque`

Then press the **Reload** button in the extensions tab.

If you encounter any problems, [please file an issue here](https://github.com/calebmpeterson/sherloque/issues).

## Buy a License

Purchasing a license enables Sherloque to index more files, thus increasing its usefulness. All versions of Sherloque still work with projects larger than the max index size, files will simply be added/removed from the index based on a Most Recently Used policy.

Sherloque comes with a 30 day money back guarantee. No questions asked :) Just [contact us here](https://www.cubicle6.com/support/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will Sherloque leak my source code?**

_No. Nope. Never._

Sherloque only connects to the Internet to periodically validate your license key. No data is ever sent to our servers for any purpose.

**Why does Sherloque require network connectivity?**

As stated above, Sherloque will periodically validate your license key with our server. Your source code is never sent. Furthermore, we do not capture any sort of telemetry data.

**Can I use Sherloque on multiple machines?**

Of course! Licenses are per-user, not per-machine. Use your license on all your machines :)

**Where did the name Sherloque come from?**

[Harrison “Sherloque” Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Wells#Sherloque_Wells) is a masterful detective from an alternate Earth in The Flash.
